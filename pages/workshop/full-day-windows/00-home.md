# Goals
The goals of this workshop are:

+ Educate developers on the IoT stack offered by Microsoft
+ Educate developers on the Universal Windows Platform (UWP)
+ Educate developers on the Azure services related to IoT

By the end of the workshop a participant will be able to:

+ Build an IoT device using the Raspberry Pi 2 (RPi2)
+ Build a UWP app for Windows IoT Core to run on the RPi2
+ Use Windows IoT Core and the RPi to both capture input and present output
+ Create and configure an Azure IoT Hub
+ Connect their UWP application running on the RPi2 to Azure IoT Hubs
+ Build a data pipeline that captures data coming into IoT Hub and stores it
+ Build a visualization of IoT data
+ Build a client application that can send a command to the IoT device via Azure

# Outline

## Getting Started (pre-workshop if possible)

## Welcome to the Internet of Things

### IoT Patterns for D2C and C2D

### Maker Hardware Landscape

### Prototyping Hardware

### Lab: Hello, Windows IoT
In this lab you will build a simple single-circuit device that blinks an LED on and off (this is the 'Hello, World! of the maker/IoT space).

## Input/Output

### GPIO

### Pulse Width Modulation

### SPI and I2C

### Lab: Nightlight
In this lab you will capture analog input using a light-dependent resistor (photo cell) and turn on or off an LED based on the amount of light detected.

## Lab: Not Quite the Nest
In this lab you will build a prototype of a device similar to, but not quite, the Nest thermostat. The device will:

+ Captures temperature and humidity and display it on either an LCD or a connected monitor
+ Enable input to alter the desired temperature
+ Turn on a RED light to indicate heating and a blue LED to indicate cooling
+ Stretch: Detects when someone approaches and comes out of sleep-mode

## Lunch

## Introduction to Azure for IoT

## Device-to-Cloud (D2C)

### Lab: Sending Device-to-Cloud Messages
In this lab you will use the thermostat device that you built to capture and send telemetry data to Azure IoT Hub.

## IoT Data Pipelines

### Lab: Storing and Displaying IoT Data
In this lab you will build a data pipeline that captures the data coming into IoT Hub and persists it using Azure storage. You will then connect a website to Azure and retrieve the data for display in a browser.

## Coud-to-Device (C2D)

### Lab: Sending Cloud-to-Device Messages
In this lab you will extend your website by adding the ability to control the thermostat remotely. The website will send messages to the thermostat via Azure.

## Wrap Up
