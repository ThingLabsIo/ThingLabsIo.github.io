In this lab you will provision a new Azure IoT Hub. Once you have the IoT Hub created, you will be able to create a new Azure IoT device (a software reference to your physical device) that you will use to send telemetry to Azure.

## Bill of Materials
What you will need:

1. An Azure Account

## Setup an Azure IoT Hub
In a browser, navigate to the Azure Portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com). Login to the account you created in the ['Getting Started' lab](../getting-started/). Once logged in:

1. Click on the __New__ menu option in the upper-left
2. Select __Internet of Things__
3. Select __Azure IoT Hub__
4. Give it a name such as your name followed by _iot-labs_ (e.g. rickgrimes-iot-labs)
5. Select or create a new __Resource Group__
6. Select a location (choose the one closest to your physical location)

Once the IoT Hub is created, navigate into it and:

1. Click on the _key_ icon at the top of the blade
2. In the next blade, click on the __iothubowner__ entry
3. Copy the __Connection string-primary key__ to your clipboard

## Install Azure IoT Hub DeviceExplorer
Azure IoT Hub only allows connections from known devices that present proper credentials. In this lab series you will use either the _DeviceExplorer_ utility or the _iothub-explorer_ command line interface to provision a device for use in Azure IoT Hub. While Azure IoT Hub supports multiple authentication schemes, you will use pre-shared keys in this lab series.

The simplest way to provision a new device is with the _DeviceExplorer_ utility (Windows only). If you are using Windows, download and run [Device Explorer][deviceexplorer]. After running the installer, the _DeviceExplorer.exe_ can be found at __C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\DeviceExplorer__. When you run the utility you need to input the _iothubowner_ connection strong (from the previous step) in the _IoT Hub Connection String_ field found in the _Configuration_ tab.

### Optional: Install the IoT Hub Explorer Command Line Interface
If you prefer to use a command line interface instead of the _DeviceExplorer_ utility, you can install the _iothub-explorer_ command line interface. The iothub-explorer tool enables you to provision devices in your IoT hub. It runs on any computer where Node.js is available. You can install Node.js from [NodeJS.org](https://nodejs.org).

On Windows, open the Node.js command prompt and type the following:
<pre>
  npm install -g iothub-explorer
  npm update -g iothub-explorer
</pre>

## Create a New Azure IoT Device

If you are using the _DeviceExplorer_ simply open the _Management_ tab and click the _Create_ button. In the dialog that opens, enter the name of your device as your name followed by _Hub_ - e.g. _RickGrimesHub_. Then Click the _Create_ button, and click _Done_ on the confirmation dialog that opens.

You will see your device in the _Devices_ list. Once a device is created, you can get the device-specific connection string by selecting it in the _Devices_ list, right-clicking and selecting _Copy connection string for selected device_:

### Optional: Create a New Azure IoT Device from the Command Line
If you are on a non-Windows machine, or prefer to use a command line interface instead of the _DeviceExplorer_ utility, you can provision a new Azure IoT Hub device using the _iothub-explorer_ command line interface.

In the same directory as before, using the Node.js command prompt or Terminal:

<pre>
  iothub-explorer [YOUR IOT HUB CONNECTION STRING] create [YOUR DEVICE NAME] --connection-string
</pre>

The device will be created in your IoT Hub and the device-specific connection string will be displayed. 

<img src="/images/rpi2/rpi2_iothub-explorer01.png"/> 

If you ever need to get the connection string again, you can use the <code>get</code> command:

<pre>
  iothub-explorer [YOUR IOT HUB CONNECTION STRING] get [YOUR DEVICE NAME] --connection-string
</pre>

The device-specific connection string identifies the device by name and includes a key that is only for that device, which makes authorizing and revoking that specific device much easier. Copy the device connection string somewhere that you will be able to access it in the [next lab][nextlab].

## Conclusion &amp; Next Steps
Congratulations! You have created an Azure IoT Hub that you will connect devices to. You also created a representation of a physical device in your IoT Hub. In the [next lab][nextlab] you will build a Universal Windows Application application that will collect data from the RPi2 and send it to Azure IoT Hub.
