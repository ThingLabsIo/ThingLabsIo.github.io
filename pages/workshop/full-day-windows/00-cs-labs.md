# Workshop Goals
The goals of this workshop are:

+ Educate developers on the IoT stack offerred by Microsoft
+ Educate developers on the Universal Windows Platform (UWP)
+ Educate developers on the Azure services related to IoT

By the end of the workshop a participant will be able to:

+ Build an IoT device using the Raspberry Pi 2 (RPi2)
+ Build a UWP app for Windows IoT Core to run on the RPi2
+ Use Windows IoT Core and the RPi to both capture input and present output
+ Create and configure an Azure IoT Hub
+ Connect their UWP application running on the RPi2 to Azure IoT Hubs
+ Build a datapipe line that captures data coming into IoT Hub and stores it
+ Build a visualization of IoT data
+ Build a client application that can send a command to the IoT device via Azure

# Prep Work
The following are required to prepare for the workshop. Whenever possible this section should be completed prior to the workshop day.

## Getting Started
This is a step-by-step guide to preparing your computer for the Windows 10 IoT Labs.

<a class="radius button small" href="{{ site.url }}/workshop/full-day-windows/getting-started/">Estimated time to complete: 20-minutes. Go to  'Getting Started' ›</a>

## Setting Up Your Raspberry Pi 2
The Raspberry Pi 2 is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. The Raspberry Pi 2 runs Windows 10 IoT Core.

In this lab you will install Windows 10 IoT Core on your Raspberry Pi 2.

# Lab Guides

## Lab 01: Hello, Windows IoT!
In this lab you will build a simple single-circuit device that blinks an LED on and off (this is the ‘Hello, World! of the maker/IoT space).

## Lab 02: Nightlight
In this lab you will capture analog input using a light-dependent resistor (photo cell) and turn on or off an LED based on the amount of light detected.

## Lab 03: Not Quite the Nest
In this lab you will build a prototype of a device similar to, but not quite, the Nest thermostat. The device will:

1. Captures temerature and humidity and display it on either an LCD or a connected monitor
2. Enable input to alter the desired temperature
3. Turn on a RED light to indicate heating and a blue LED to indicate cooling
4. Stretch: Detects when someone approaches and comes out of sleep-mode

## Lab 04: Setting Up Azure IoT Hub
In this lab you will provision a new Azure IoT Hub. Once you have the IoT Hub created, you will be able to create a new Azure IoT device (a software reference to your physical device) that you will use to send telemetry to Azure.

## Lab 05: Sending Device-to-Cloud (D2C) Messages
In this lab you will use the thermastat device that you built to capture and send telemetry data to Azure IoT Hub.

<a class="radius button small" href="{{ site.url }}/workshop/full-day-windows/sending-d2c-messages/">Estimated time to complete: 20-minutes. Go to  'Sending Telemetry to the Cloud' ›</a>

## Lab 06: Storing and Displaying IoT Data
In this lab you will build a data pipeline that captures the data coming into IoT Hub and persists it using Azure storage. You will then connect a website to Azure and retreive the data for display in a browser.

## Lab 07: Lab: Sending Cloud-to-Device (C2D) Messages
In this lab you will extend your website by adding the ability to control the thermastat remotely. The website will send messages to the thermastat via Azure.
