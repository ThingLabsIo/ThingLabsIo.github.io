If you are on a non-Windows machine, or prefer to use a command line interface instead of the _DeviceExplorer_ utility, you can install the _iothub-explorer_ command line interface. The _iothub-explorer_ tool enables you to provision, monitor, and delete devices in your IoT hub. It runs on any operating system where Node.js is available.

1. Download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. From a command line (Command Prompt on Windows, or Terminal on Mac OS X), execute the following:

```
npm install -g iothub-explorer
```
