The simplest way to provision a new device is with the _DeviceExplorer_ utility (Windows only). If you are using Windows, download and run [Device Explorer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md). After running the installer, the _DeviceExplorer.exe_ can be found at __C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\DeviceExplorer__. When you run the utility you need to input the _iothubowner_ connection strong (from the previous step) in the _IoT Hub Connection String_ field found in the _Configuration_ tab.
