If you are on a non-Windows machine, or prefer to use a command line interface instead of the _DeviceExplorer_ utility, you can provision a new Azure IoT Hub device using the _iothub-explorer_ command line interface.

In the same directory as before, using the Node.js command prompt or Terminal, execute the following command: (you may need to wrap the connections string in quotes, depending on the command line application you are using)

<pre>
  iothub-explorer "[YOUR IOT HUB CONNECTION STRING]" create Thingy --connection-string
</pre>

Once a device is created, the device information, including the device-specific connection string, will be displayed.

The device-specific connection string identifies the device by name and includes a key that is only for that device. Make a note of the device connection string; you will need it in the next lab.
